        <h3>Our History</h3>
        <p>
          It started with a spark ‚Äî a hallway sketch, a shared doodle in the
          corner of a notebook, a moment where color met courage. A small group
          of creators at Brinbeal Secondary College wanted more than just art
          class ‚Äî they wanted a place where imagination could breathe wild and
          free. So the club was born. No limits. No wrong strokes. Just a blank
          canvas and big dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since day one, we‚Äôve been a home for the creators, the thinkers, the
          makers. Whether you're into painting, digital art, photography,
          poetry, fashion, or just vibing with creative energy ‚Äî this is your
          space.
